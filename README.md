# awesomeTravelPlanner
This web provides users travel plan service in New York City. Users can get initial recommended places after selecting the length of days. By deleting and changing the initial places, they can decide which places they want to visit. The recommended routes will be calculated based on the chosen places then, and the user can also change the visiting orders and get customized routes. In addition, user can get an overview of the tour and print out the final plans! :smiley
